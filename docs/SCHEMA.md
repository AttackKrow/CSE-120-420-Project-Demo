# Event schema

Every row is one **event**: a process segment consumed an input lot and produced an output lot. The genealogy is
the graph whose edges are `in_lot_uuid → out_lot_uuid`. Files are Parquet; the Arrow schema is
`mesgen.schema.EVENT_SCHEMA`.

## Lot identity

- **Names and states.** A lot keeps its **name** for life. Every event that touches it increments its **sequence**, and `lot_uuid` identifies that state of the lot.
- **No cycles.** The sequence only increases, so the uuid graph has no cycles. A lot that is reworked keeps its name and returns to an earlier step.
- **Key nodes on `lot_uuid`, never on (name, sequence).** A re-mint gives one (name, sequence) a second uuid; see the anomalies below.

## Columns

| Column | Type | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `id` | int64 | Row id: unique, increasing in the order rows were emitted. Duplicate rows have their own id. |
| `event_ts` | timestamp[us] | Equals `begin_ts`. Every row is written to the partition of its own `event_ts` day and hour. |
| `begin_ts`, `end_ts` | timestamp[us] | Event start and end, on a simulated clock that starts at 2000-01-03. Most events have zero duration because the event corresponds to an MES transaction. |
| `segment_name` | string | Process segment type (e.g., `SEG_017`). |
| `segment_uuid` | string | Id of one **execution** of a segment. All inputs to a blending step share the same `segment_uuid`; each child of a one-to-many step has a unique `segment_uuid`. |
| `operation_id` | string | A second per-execution id, always paired with `segment_uuid`. |
| `in_lot_name`, `in_lot_sequence`, `in_lot_uuid` | string, int32, string | Input lot state. Null for creation events. |
| `in_material` | string | Material of the input lot (e.g., `MAT_07`). |
| `in_lot_status` | string | `ST_1` (normal) or `ST_2` (scrapped). See "Scrap and disposal" below. |
| `in_prev_segment` | string | `segment_uuid` of the event that produced the input lot. |
| `out_lot_name`, `out_lot_sequence`, `out_lot_uuid` | string, int32, string | Output lot state. Null only for disposal events. |
| `out_material` | string | Material of the output lot. |
| `out_lot_status` | string | `ST_1` (normal) or `ST_2` (scrapped). The scrap event sets `ST_2`; a recovery sets `ST_1` again. |
| `location`, `location_type` | string | Where the event happened. `location` is one-to-one with `equipment_path`. Types: `LINE`, `STORAGE`, `STATION`, `STATION_GROUP`, `DOCK`. Storage moves are ordinary events: they bump the sequence. |
| `equipment_path` | string | Equipment id (e.g., `AR03/EQ_041`): area followed by equipment. |
| `operator` | string | Operator id (e.g., `OP_017`). |
| `work_order_id` | string | Always null. |
| `disposition` | string | `DISP_1` (scrap), only on scrap events; `DISP_2` (use as is: the lot continues), on process steps; `disp_1`, a lower-case spelling of `DISP_1` that appears from week 4; or null. |
| `disposition_codes` | string (JSON) | Codes for the disposition: `{"D_1": code, "D_2": process, "D_3": action, "D_4": code2, "D_5": code3}`. |
| `ext_system_ref` | string | A reference into another system. |
| `qty_in`, `qty_out`, `qty_net`, `qty_available`, `qty_scheduled` | float64 | Quantities. Discrete lots: `qty_in = 1`, `qty_out` 0 or 1. Rolls: integer lengths. Mass lots: mass units. |
| `unit` | string | `MU` (mass unit) for mass lots, otherwise null. |
| `in_properties`, `out_properties` | string (JSON) | Property bags for the input and output lot. Keys (`P_042`) appear and retire over time, and value types drift. |
| `recipe_json` | string (JSON) | Recipe parameters (`R_01` to `R_07`) for segments that run a recipe, otherwise null. `R_03` is the recipe name. The same for every row of one segment execution. |

## Event classes

| Class | Definition |
|---|---|
| creation | `in_lot_uuid` null, `out_lot_uuid` set: a raw material, roll or consumable enters |
| sequence bump | `in_lot_name = out_lot_name`, sequence + 1: a line step, a storage move or a material change |
| transformation | different lot names: a merge input, a split child, a dispense |
| disposal | `out_lot_uuid` null: a scrapped lot is disposed of after a stay in storage (rare) |

Three kinds of material coexist:
- **Mass:** non-integer quantities, blended about five at a time.
- **Rolls:** integer lengths in the hundreds to thousands, each cut into hundreds of discrete lots.
- **Discrete units:** `qty_in = 1`, one sequence bump per step; more than 99% of events.

## Scrap and disposal

Scrapping, disposal and recovery each have their own step, used for nothing else: `SEG_057`, `SEG_058` and `SEG_059`
in the default profile. A scrapped lot goes through these events:

1. **The process step that finds a problem says nothing about scrap.** It may carry `DISP_2` (use as is), but never `DISP_1`.
2. **The scrap event.** The lot passes the scrap step (`SEG_057`). It keeps its name, gets the next sequence, and its status changes from `ST_1` to `ST_2`. Most scrap events carry `DISP_1` and its codes; the rest record only the status change.
3. **Most scrapped lots stop there**, and never appear again.
4. **Some are stored, then disposed of.** A storage check-in and a check-out, both with status `ST_2`, are followed later by a disposal at the disposal step (`SEG_058`). That is the only event with no output lot.
5. **A few are recovered.** The recovery step (`SEG_059`) sets the status back to `ST_1`, and the lot continues its route from the step after the one that found the problem.

Units that fail the test step (`SEG_041`) because of a scenario's planted causes are scrapped the same way, right after it.

## Duplicates and anomalies

The raw rows contain duplicates on purpose. Deduplicate before loading: keep one row per
`(in_lot_uuid, out_lot_uuid, segment_uuid, begin_ts)`, preferring the row with a non-null `in_prev_segment`, then the
lowest `id`:

```sql
qualify row_number() over (partition by in_lot_uuid, out_lot_uuid, segment_uuid, begin_ts
                           order by in_prev_segment is null, id) = 1
```

The duplicate kinds:
- **null twin:** identical except that `in_prev_segment` is null; about 56% of events have one;
- **exact copy;**
- **conflicting copy:** the operator differs, and the copy has the higher `id`.

A row and its copies share every timestamp, so they are always in the same file.

Anomalies, at low rates:
- **Legacy lots:** inputs whose producing event is absent, because they were made before the scenario starts.
- **Clock skew:** events dated up to an hour before their producer's event on the same day.
- **Re-mints:** a `(name, sequence)` key issued twice, with two uuids.

After deduplication, the uuid graph has no cycles, each state has one producing execution, and each edge comes from one row.

## Time

The simulated clock starts at 2000-01-03 (`epoch` in `manifest.json`); day `D` starts `D` days later. `base/` holds
the first `base_days` days, one file per day, and `stream/` the rest, one file per hour. Each row sits in the file of
its own `event_ts` day and hour.

Within a file, rows are in `id` order. That is the order rows were emitted, not necessarily `event_ts` order.

Rows dated after the scenario's last day are not written; the manifest counts them as `rows_beyond_horizon`.

## Churn

`churn_log.parquet` lists every change to the process, with its simulated time:
- **C1, new instance:** new equipment or a new operator.
- **C2, new type:** a new segment, material, property key or vocabulary variant. Some new segments retire after a week.
- **C3, structural change:** a new input material at a merge, or a new step inserted in a route.
